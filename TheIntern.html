           <img src="img/intern.jpeg" alt="The Intern(Movie poster)" class="movie">
           <h4>Mood lightning, cheerful and real- A must watch</h4>
           <p>It's a great watch and unusually real. 
               You can easily relate to the characters specially if you've ever in 
               life been an intern, you'll feel the nostalgia when you see Robert de Niro's 
               Ben Whittaker all lively and pumped when he's selected as a senior-intern under 
               Anne Hathaway's Jules Ostin. Like every newbie at work, although he is not, he 
               longs to get some tasks and help his mentor in every way possible. In the beginning
                you pity the 70-year-old retired and widowed Ben for being slightly neglected or 
                ill-treated by the workaholic, passionate, never tiring, ambitious and successful 
                Jules, but that is short lived and He wins her confidence and heart in a couple of
                 days.</p>
            <p>    
            The whole movie revolves around Ben's life and how he cheers up everybody around
             him all the time with his cuteness and wisdom. The actors have done very decent work 
             and you can easily gel in the movie and feel the life in it. The music too is very
              jovial and sets your mood from the first minute of the runtime. The movie presents 
              some very important aspects of the society in a very subtle yet effective way like 
              how a woman is prejudiced at work or as leaders, how the new generation boys in the 
              pursuit of being cool no longer remain a gentleman, marriage life problems etc. A pinch
               of comedy here and there adds up to the fun content, and a few personal life tensions 
               of Jules balances it very beautifully and how She comes out of it is remarkable and
            worth taking lessons from. <br>
            Overall a very good watch if you're looking to uplift your
             mood (which is always, because that's why people turn to movies).</p>
